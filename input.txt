In this tutorial we are going to see how to use RandomAccessFile in order to to 
read and write data to a File (in random positions). The RandomAccessFile class 
treats the file as an array of Bytes. You can write your data in any position of 
the "array". To do that, it uses a pointer that holds the current position 
(you can think of the file pointer as a cursor in a text editor).

The RandomAccessFile does that using:

    getFilePointer() to get the current position of the pointer
    seek(int ) to set the position of the pointer
    read(byte[] b) to reads up to b.length bytes of data from the file into an array of bytes
    write(byte[] b) to write b.length bytes from the specified byte array to the file, starting at the current file pointer position
